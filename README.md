# GetIpAddress
Module with java action to get the IP address of the client.

Just drag the java action into a microflow and the client IP address is returned as a string. Easy as that!

Possible usecases are when you want to prompt 2FA if you are logging in from a certain location, or when you only want to view certain documents from certain locations.

Use this in the cloud. If used locally you'll just get your localhost IP.
